# Docker

## Requirements
You will need a fairly recent version of Docker (https://docs.docker.com/install/)

We will use the following Docker images in this chapter:

- Graylog: graylog/graylog
- MongoDB: mongo
- Elasticsearch: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch

### Quick start

If you simply want to checkout Graylog without any further customization, you can run the following three commands to create the necessary environment:
```bash
 docker run --name mongo -d mongo:3
 docker run --name elasticsearch \
    -e "http.host=0.0.0.0" -e "xpack.security.enabled=false" \
    -d docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:5.6.2
 docker run --link mongo --link elasticsearch \
    -p 9000:9000 -p 12201:12201 -p 514:514 \
    -e GRAYLOG_WEB_ENDPOINT_URI="http://127.0.0.1:9000/api" \
    -d graylog/graylog:2.4.0-1 
```

### How to get log data in
You can create different kinds of inputs under System / Inputs, however you can only use ports that have been properly mapped to your docker container, otherwise data will not go through.

For example, to start a Raw/Plaintext TCP input on port 5555, stop your container and recreate it, whilst appending ```-p 5555:5555``` to your [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/) command:
```bash
docker run --link mongo --link elasticsearch \
    -p 9000:9000 -p 12201:12201 -p 514:514 -p 5555:5555 \
    -e GRAYLOG_WEB_ENDPOINT_URI="http://127.0.0.1:9000/api" \
    -d graylog/graylog:2.4.0-1
```

Similarly, the same can be done for UDP by appending ```-p 5555:5555/udp```

After that you can send a plaintext message to the Graylog Raw/Plaintext TCP input running on port 5555 using the following command:
```bash
echo 'First log message' | nc localhost 5555
```

### Settings
Graylog comes with a default configuration that works out of the box but you have to set a password for the admin user and the web interface needs to know how to connect from your browser to the Graylog REST API.

Both settings can be configured via environment variables (also see Configuration):

```text
-e GRAYLOG_ROOT_PASSWORD_SHA2=8c6976e5b5410415bde908bd4dee15dfb167a9c873fc4bb8a81f6f2ab448a918
-e GRAYLOG_WEB_ENDPOINT_URI="http://127.0.0.1:9000/api"
```

In this case you can login to Graylog with the username and password ```admin```.

Generate your own admin password with the following command and put the SHA-256 hash into the ```GRAYLOG_ROOT_PASSWORD_SHA2``` environment variable:
```bash
echo -n yourpassword | shasum -a 256
```

All these settings and command line parameters can be put in a ```docker-compose.yml``` file, so that they donâ€™t have to be executed one after the other.

Example:
[Docker Compose](docker-compose-general-example.yml)

After starting all three Docker containers by running docker-compose up, you can open the URL ```http://127.0.0.1:9000``` in a web browser and log in with ```username admin``` and ```password admin``` (make sure to change the password later).

# Configuration
Every configuration option can be set via [environment variables](/misc/graylog.conf). Simply prefix the parameter name with ```GRAYLOG_``` and put it all in upper case.

For example, setting up the SMTP configuration for sending Graylog alert notifications via email, the `docker-compose.yml` would look like this:

[Docker compose with SMPT](docker-compose-general-example-smtp.yml){:target="_blank"}
